## README FILE DESCRIBING 0x14-bit_manipulation
Bit manipulation is the process of applying logical operations on a sequence of bits to achieve a required result. It is an act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word.

Computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:

Low-level device control
Error detection and correction algorithms
Data compression
Encryption algorithms
Optimization
For most other tasks, modern programming languages allow the programmer to work directly with abstractions instead of bits representing those abstractions.
